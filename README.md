<h2>My story</h2>
at 9-10 years old i was fascinated by minecraft and wanted to make my own game with MY custom updates 
so i found an app that was supposed to teach me. It was called Mimo. As a yung boy i did not know the diiference between web dev. and app dev. 
I was so satisfied with my work with HTML 
At 11 years old after a lot of exercices i understood dev. in general and learned c# for Unity and tarted coding my games the first one is lost but my latest progect is in <a href="https://github.com/virous360/kingdomOnline">this repository </a>
One day i got ransomware on my device so all my files got encrypted.
I stopped game dev. since and shifted to cyber sec. I focus most on malware analysis and a bit of pintesting for fun
